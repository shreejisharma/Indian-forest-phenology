A **100% data-driven Streamlit application** for extracting and predicting phenological events —
**Start of Season (SOS)**, **Peak of Season (POS)**, and **End of Season (EOS)** — from any uploaded
NDVI time series and NASA POWER meteorological data. Works for **any Indian forest type** with
zero hardcoded presets — every threshold, cadence, amplitude floor, and feature ranking is derived
exclusively from your data.

## v5 Core Design — 100% Data-Governed

**No forest-type dropdown. No lookup tables. No hardcoded numbers.**
You provide only the growing-window start and end month — everything else is computed from your data.

| Parameter | Old (hardcoded) | v5 (data-driven) |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| NDVI cadence | 16 days assumed | `median(observed date diffs)` |
| Max interpolation gap | 60 days fixed | `8 × detected cadence` |
| Trough min separation | 145 days fixed | `40% of autocorrelation cycle period` |
| SG smoother window | 31 steps fixed | `42% of detected cycle period` |
| Minimum amplitude | 0.02 fixed | `5% of P5–P95 NDVI range` |
| Amplitude-gap threshold | 0.10 fixed | `10% of global amplitude` |
| Feature priority | hardcoded list per event | pure Pearson + Spearman from data |
| Correlation gate | 0.40 fixed | sidebar slider (0.20–0.70) |
| Min season length | 150 days fixed | `35% of detected cycle` (or user override) |

## Bug Fixes (v2 → v7)

| Fix | Description |
|-----|------------|
| **v2** | Plateau trough filter: 85% adaptive ceiling; disabled for low-amplitude evergreen forests |
| **v3** | SG window data-derived (≤ 42% of cycle); `MIN_AMPLITUDE` = 5% of P5–P95 NDVI range |
| **v4** | Gap tolerance scales with amplitude — 50% tolerant for strong signals, 20% strict for weak |
| **v5** | Head/tail segment extraction with amplitude-aware gap checks |
| **v6** | `season_start` derived from POS date — eliminates blank windows in cross-year configs |
| **v6b** | `POS_Date` = raw NDVI maximum (not smoothed peak) |
| **v7** | Deduplicate by `Season_Start` (not calendar `Year`) — no window ever left blank |

## Data Requirements

### NDVI CSV
```
Date,NDVI
2016-01-01,0.42
2016-01-17,0.45
2016-02-02,0.51
```
Column names are auto-detected (case-insensitive). Supports MODIS 16-day, Sentinel-2 monthly,
or any irregular composite. Multi-site: add a `site_key` column — app shows a site selector.

### NASA POWER Meteorological CSV
Download from [NASA POWER Data Access](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/).
Select **Daily** temporal resolution and **Point** geometry. Recommended parameters:

| Parameter | Variable | Role |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Mean temperature 2m | `T2M` | GDD, VPD |
| Min temperature 2m | `T2M_MIN` | SOS trigger |
| Max temperature 2m | `T2M_MAX` | Heat stress |
| Precipitation | `PRECTOTCORR` | Monsoon trigger |
| Relative humidity | `RH2M` | Moisture proxy |
| Surface soil wetness | `GWETTOP` | Leaf flush |
| Root zone soil wetness | `GWETROOT` | Drought resistance |
| Wind speed 2m | `WS2M` | Senescence (EOS) |
| Incoming solar radiation | `ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN` | POS timing |

The app **automatically derives**: `GDD_5`, `GDD_10`, `GDD_cum`, `DTR`, `VPD`, `SPEI_proxy`,
`log_precip`, `MSI`, `T2M_RANGE`.

## Methodology

### Phenology Extraction — Valley-Anchored Amplitude Method
1. Gaps > `8 × cadence` preserved as NaN (not interpolated across large gaps)
2. NDVI resampled to 5-day grid by linear interpolation within valid segments
3. Per-segment Savitzky-Golay smoothing (window ≤ 42% of dominant cycle period)
4. Valley (trough) detection — minimum separation = 40% of autocorrelation cycle period
5. Amplitude `A = NDVI_max − NDVI_min` computed from raw 5-day values per cycle
6. Threshold = `NDVI_min + threshold% × A`
7. SOS = first crossing on ascending limb
8. EOS = last crossing on descending limb
9. POS = **raw NDVI maximum** between SOS and EOS (not smoothed peak)

### Regression Model
1. 15-day pre-event meteorological windows computed per season per event
2. Features ranked by composite score = `max(|Pearson r|, |Spearman ρ|)` — no preset list
3. Correlation gate: composite ≥ threshold (default 0.40, adjustable via sidebar slider)
4. Collinearity filter: `|r| > 0.85` between candidates → weaker feature dropped
5. Incremental LOO R² check: feature added only if it improves LOO R² by ≥ 0.03
6. Ridge Regression / LOESS / Polynomial / Gaussian Process — user-selectable

### Consistency Guarantee
Pearson r and significance shown in the **Training tab** and the **Correlations tab heatmap** are
computed from the **same `corr_tables` object** — they are always identical.

## Model Performance (R² LOO)

| R² | Interpretation |
|----|---------------|
| > 0.80 | Strong predictability |
| 0.50–0.80 | Good |
| 0.30–0.50 | Moderate — acceptable for short records |
| < 0.30 | Weak — collect more years of data |
